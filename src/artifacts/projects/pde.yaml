    Anti-alising is a technique used in computer graphics to reduce the visual artifacts known as aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution.

    The algorithm is a variant of the geometric heat equation, but instead of promoting diffusion along edges, it promotes diffusion across edges while preserving other features of the image, achieving a similar effect to anti-alising.
