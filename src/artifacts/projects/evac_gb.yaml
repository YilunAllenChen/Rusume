    GreenEVT is a city-scale evacuation simulator with a focus on high-dimensional constraints and objectives - not just city traffic, but also load on the power grid due to charging electric vehicles.
    
    I was tasked to maintain the codebase for the hybrid simulator, and optimize its performance. With tactics like memoization and parallel computing, I managed to achieve a 5x speedup.
