    This project aims to build a self driving car in Grand Theft Auto V.

    The camera capture is done in C++ using the OpenCV library, and the neural network is trained in Python.

    The output of the neural net is then fed into both a simulation environment to reconstruct the state of the world, and a controller to control the car.
