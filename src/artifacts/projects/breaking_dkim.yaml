    DKIM is a widely used email authentication protocol. It is used to verify that the email is sent from the claimed sender, and that the email is not tampered with in transit.
    
    An attacker is able to spoof any identity and change the content of the email any way they want, as long as the spoofed identity is whitelisted by the victim. 
    (Note: Not that the attacker is whitelisted, but the identity that the attacker pretends to be, is whitelisted).
